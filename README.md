# Tools
Various tools, mostly generated by LLMs.

Inspired by https://github.com/simonw/tools

## Project Structure
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts and HTML templates for site generation.
  - `generate_index.py`: The main script that crawls the `tools/` directory for HTML files, generates an `index.html` list, and injects a consistent footer into all files.
  - `index_template.html`, `footer_template.html`, `link_template.html`: Templates used by the generator script.
- `dist/`: (Auto-generated) Contains the final, processed HTML files ready for deployment. This folder is ignored by git.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

## Local Development

### Using Just (Recommended)
This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner for convenience.

- `just build`: Generates the `dist/` folder.
- `just serve`: Builds and serves the site from `dist/`.
- `just dev`: Serves the `tools/` directory directly (useful for hot-reload debugging of individual tools).
- `just clean`: Removes the `dist/` folder.

### Generating the Site
To generate the `dist/` folder locally, run:
```bash
python scripts/generate_index.py
```

### Serving Locally
After generating the site, you can preview it by serving the `dist/` directory:

#### Using Python
```bash
python -m http.server --directory dist
```

#### Using Node.js (npx)
```bash
npx http-server dist
```
